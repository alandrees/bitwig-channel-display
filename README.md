# bitwig-channel-display
Channel display output for bitwig studio on 20x4 LCD screen

This is the javascript/bitwig side of the code.

This first version sends via midi to the raspberry pi.

The pi needs to be connected via MIDI (for now, OSC support is planned), and the PI needs to be running the companion script python-channel-display [https://www.github.com/alandrees/python-channel-display].
